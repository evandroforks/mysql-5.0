  Bug#21543: 5.0.24 breaks ABI compatibility for python bindings: \
  	InterfaceError on connect
  
  Removed the bool flag from the st_mysql_options struct, since it adds 
  another word in size to the memory size and shifts member memory locations
  down, both of which break binary-interface compatibility.
  
  Instead, use a flag, 2**30, in the client_options bit-field to represent
  that the client should check the SSL certificate of the server.

  include/mysql.h@1.159, 2006-08-25 11:54:31-04:00, cmiller@zippy.cornsilk.net +0 -1

  Fix for BUG#16899: Possible buffer overflow in handling of DEFINER-clause
      
  User name (host name) has limit on length. The server code relies on these
  limits when storing the names. The problem was that sometimes these limits
  were not checked properly, so that could lead to buffer overflow.
    
  The fix is to check length of user/host name in parser and if string is too
  long, throw an error.
